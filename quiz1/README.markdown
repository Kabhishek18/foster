I learn to create a Quiz, Test or Exam software using JavaScript and HTML. The main objective is to give the user multiple choice questions one at a time in sequence and grade them at the end of the exam. Perfect for school classrooms or educational entities online. 
You can easily add a timer with setInterval(), and apply all the bells and whistles you need using JavaScript. Storing the questions/answers/options in a secure database that PHP can access, is the most practical way to make sure people do not cheat when you need the test to be secure and cheat proof. Ajax requests would be a big part of that interaction with the server.
